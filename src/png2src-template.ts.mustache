{{! Enable a crazy hack to edit the sprite data in memory
using an external image editor, by scanning for
sentinel values in memory and writing to the memory between them,
using scanmem.
See png2mem.py

These sentinels must be defined immediately before and after
the sprite data, but don't need to be actually used by the program.
(It doesn't seem to "tree shake" them away, which is good in this case.)

Also note that I'm using a special replacement on top of the mustache template,
for the sentinels. This is done in png2src.py
(This wouldn't be needed if assemblyscript could cast a string to an array of bytes somehow.)
