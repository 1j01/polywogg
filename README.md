# Polywogg

A game written in AssemblyScript for the [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org) fantasy console.

## Building

First install Node.js and WASM-4 if you haven't already. WASM-4 can be downloaded manually, or installed with npm by running:

```bash
npm install -g wasm4
```

Then setup the project by running:

```shell
npm install
```

Build and run the game with:

```shell
npm start
```

This will open a page in your browser and automatically reload when you make changes.

For more info about setting up WASM-4, see the [quickstart guide](https://wasm4.org/docs/getting-started/setup?code-lang=assemblyscript#quickstart).
